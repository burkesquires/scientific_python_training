    "Using the Hashing Vectorizer makes it possible to implement streaming and parallel text classification but can also introduce some issues:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The collisions can introduce too much noise in the data and degrade prediction quality,\n",
    "- The `HashingVectorizer` does not provide \"Inverse Document Frequency\" reweighting (lack of a `use_idf=True` option).\n",
    "- There is no easy way to inverse the mapping and find the feature names from the feature index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collision issues can be controlled by increasing the `n_features` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IDF weighting might be reintroduced by appending a `TfidfTransformer` instance on the output of the vectorizer. However computing the `idf_` statistic used for the feature reweighting will require to do at least one additional pass over the training set before being able to start training the classifier: this breaks the online learning scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of inverse mapping (the `get_feature_names()` method of `TfidfVectorizer`) is even harder to workaround. That would require extending the `HashingVectorizer` class to add a \"trace\" mode to record the mapping of the most important features to provide statistical debugging information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mean time to debug feature extraction issues, it is recommended to use `TfidfVectorizer(use_idf=False)` on a small-ish subset of the dataset to simulate a `HashingVectorizer()` instance that have the `get_feature_names()` method and no collision issues."
