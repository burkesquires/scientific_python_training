    "Essentially, all of the algorithms in Machine Learning are nothing more than a complex equation that needs to be minimized with the help of given data.\n",

    "Roots of an Equation\n",
    "NumPy is capable of finding roots for polynomials and linear equations, but it can not find roots for non linear equations, like this one:\n",

    "x + cos(x)\n",

    "For that you can use SciPy's optimze.root function.\n",

    "This function takes two required arguments:\n",

    "fun - a function representing an equation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The function returns an object with information regarding the solution.\n",

    "The actual solution is given under attribute x of the returned object:\n",
