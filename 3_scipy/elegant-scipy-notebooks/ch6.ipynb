    "example, if a node is connected to five other nodes in a graph, its degree\n",
    "is 5. (Later, we will differentiate between out-degree and in-degree, when edges\n",
    "have a \"from\" and \"to\".) In matrix terms, the degree corresponds to the *sum*\n",

    "The __*Laplacian* matrix of a graph__ (just \"the Laplacian\" for short) is defined\n",

    "An eigenvector $v$ of a matrix $M$ is a vector that\n",

    "## PageRank: linear algebra for reputation and importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Another application of linear algebra and eigenvectors is Google's PageRank\n",
    "algorithm, which is punnily named both for webpages and for one of its\n",
    "co-founders, Larry Page.\n",
    "\n",
    "To rank webpages by importance, you might count\n",
    "how many other webpages link to it. After all, if everyone is linking to a\n",
    "particular page, it must be good, right? But this metric is\n",
    "easily gamed: to make your own webpage rise in the rankings, just\n",
    "create as many other webpages as you can and have them all link to your\n",
    "original page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight that drove Google's early success was that important webpages\n",
    "are not linked to by just many webpages, but by *important*\n",
    "webpages. And how do we know that those other pages are important? Because\n",
    "they themselves are linked to by important pages. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recursive definition implies that page\n",
    "importance can be measured by an eigenvector\n",
    "of the so-called *transition matrix*, which contains the links\n",
    "between webpages. Suppose you have your vector of importance $\\boldsymbol{r}$,\n",
    "and your matrix of links $M$. You don't know $\\boldsymbol{r}$ yet, but you\n",
    "do know that the importance of a page is proportional to the sum of\n",
    "importances of the pages that link to it: $\\boldsymbol{r} = \\alpha M \\boldsymbol{r}$,\n",
    "or $M \\boldsymbol{r} = \\lambda \\boldsymbol{r}$, for $\\lambda = 1/\\alpha$. That's\n",
    "just the definition of an eigenvalue!\n",
    "\n",
    "By ensuring some special properties are satisfied by the transition matrix, we\n",
    "can further determine that the required eigenvalue is 1, and that it is the\n",
    "largest eigenvalue of $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition matrix imagines a web\n",
    "surfer, often named Webster, randomly clicking a link from each webpage he\n",
    "visits, and then asks, what's the probability that he ends up at any given\n",
    "page? This probability is called the PageRank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Google's rise, researchers have been applying PageRank to all sorts of\n",
    "networks. We'll use an example by Stefano Allesina and Mercedes Pascual,\n",

    "in PLoS Computational Biology. They thought to apply the method in ecological\n",
    "*food webs*, networks that link species to those that they eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naively, if you wanted to see how critical a species was for an ecosystem, you\n",
    "would look at how many species eat it. If it's many, and that species\n",
    "disappeared, then all its \"dependent\" species might disappear with it. In\n",
    "network parlance, you could say that its *in-degree* determines its ecological\n",
    "importance.\n",

    "Could PageRank be a better measure of importance for an ecosystem?\n",
