    "\n",
    "Before performing assembly, it is vital to perform read correction.\n",
    "During DNA sequencing some bases are incorrectly read out, and must be fixed, or they will mess up the assembly.\n",
    "(Imagine having puzzle pieces with the wrong shape.)\n",

    "One correction strategy is to find similar reads in your dataset and fix the error by grabbing the correct information from those reads. Or alternatively, you may choose to completely discard those reads containing errors.\n",

    "[Pavel Pevzner and others](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/17/9748.full) realized that reads could be broken down into smaller, overlapping *k-mers*, substrings of length k, which can then be stored in a hash table (a dictionary, in Python).\n",
    "This has tons of advantages, but the main one is that instead of computing on the total number of reads, which can be arbitrarily large, we can compute on the total number of k-mers, which can only be as large as the genome itself — usually 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose a value for k that is large enough to ensure any k-mer appears only once in the genome, the number of times a k-mer appears is exactly the number of reads that originate from that part of the genome.\n",
    "This is called the *coverage* of that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a read has an error in it, there is a high probability that the k-mers overlapping the error will be unique or close to unique in the genome.\n",
    "Think of the equivalent in English: if you were to take reads from Shakespeare, and one read was \"to be or nob to be\", the 6-mer \"nob to\" will appear rarely or not at all, whereas \"not to\" will be very frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basis for k-mer error correction: split the reads into k-mers, count the occurrence of each k-mer, and use some logic to replace rare k-mers in reads with similar common ones.\n",

    "Haskell Curry is also the namesake of the Haskell programming language — in which\n",
    "*all* functions are curried!\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Currying\" means *partially* evaluating a function and returning another, \"smaller\" function.\n",
    "Normally in Python if you don't give a function all of its required arguments then it will throw a fit.\n",
    "In contrast, a curried function can just take *some* of those arguments.\n",
    "If the curried function doesn't get enough arguments, it returns a new function that takes the leftover arguments.\n",
    "Once that second function is called with the remaining arguments, it can perform the original task.\n",
    "Another word for currying is partial evaluation.\n",
    "In functional programming, currying is a way to produce a function that can wait for the rest of the arguments to show up later.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while the function call `map(np.log, numbers_list)` applies the `np.log`\n",
    "function to all of the numbers in `numbers_list` (returning a sequence of the\n",
    "logged numbers), the call `toolz.curried.map(np.log)` returns a *function* that\n",
