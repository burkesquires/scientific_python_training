    "The SciPy ecosystem is a loosely defined collection of Python packages.\n",
    "In Elegant SciPy we will meet many of its main players:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumPy** is the foundation of scientific computing in Python. It\n",
    "provides efficient numeric arrays and  wide support for numerical computation, including linear algebra, random numbers, and Fourier transforms.\n",
    "NumPy's killer feature is its \"N-dimensional arrays\", or `ndarray`.\n",
    "These data structures store numeric values efficiently and define a grid in any number of dimensions (more about this later).\n",
    "http://www.numpy.org/\n",
    "* **SciPy**, the library,\n",
    "is a collection of efficient numerical algorithms for domains such as signal processing, integration, optimization, and statistics.\n",
    "These are wrapped in user-friendly interfaces.\n",
    "http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html\n",
    "* **Matplotlib**\n",
    "is a powerful package for plotting in two dimensions (and basic 3D). It draws its name from its Matlab-inspired syntax.\n",
    "http://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "* **IPython**\n",
    "is an interactive interface for Python, which allows you to quickly interact with your data and test ideas.\n",
    "https://ipython.org/\n",
    "* The **Jupyter**\n",
    "notebook runs in your browser and allows the construction of rich documents that combine code, text, mathematical expressions, and interactive widgets[^literate_computing].\n",
    "In fact, to produce this book, the text is converted to Jupyter notebooks and executed (that way, we know that all the examples execute correctly).\n",
    "Jupyter started out as an IPython extension, but now supports multiple languages, including Cython, Julia, R, Octave, Bash, Perl and Ruby.\n",
    "http://jupyter.org\n",
    "* **pandas**\n",
    "provides fast, columnar data structures in an easy-to-use package.\n",
    "It is particularly suited to working with labelled data sets such as tables or relational databases, and for managing time series data and sliding windows.\n",
    "Pandas also has some handy data analysis tools for data parsing and cleaning, aggregation, and plotting.\n",
    "http://pandas.pydata.org/\n",
    "* **scikit-learn**\n",
    "provides a unified interface to machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "## SciPy Ecosystem and Community\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy is a major library with a lot of functionality.\n",
    "Together with NumPy, it is one of Python's killer apps.\n",
    "It has launched a vast number of related libraries that build on this functionality, many of which you'll encounter throughout this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creators of these libraries, and many of their users, gather at many events and conferences around the world.\n",
    "These include the yearly SciPy conference in Austin (USA), EuroSciPy, SciPy India, PyData and others.\n",
    "We highly recommend attending one of these, and meeting the authors of the best scientific software in the Python world.\n",
    "If you can't get there, or simply want a taste of these conferences,\n",
    "many publish their talks online (see, e.g., [https://www.youtube.com/user/EnthoughtMedia/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/EnthoughtMedia/playlists)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free and open-source software (FOSS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SciPy community embraces open source software development.\n",
    "The source code for nearly all SciPy libraries is freely available to read, edit and reuse by anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want others to use your code, one of the best ways to achieve this is to make it free and open.\n",
    "If you use closed source software, but it doesn't do exactly what you want to achieve, you're out of luck.\n",
    "You can email the developer and ask them to add a new feature (this often doesn't work!), or write new software yourself.\n",
    "If the code is open source, you can easily add or modify its functionality using the skills you learn from this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if you find a bug in a piece of software, having access to the source code can make things a lot easier for both the user and the developer.\n",
    "Even if you don't quite understand the code, you can usually get a lot further along in diagnosing the problem, and help the developer with fixing it.\n",
    "It is usually a learning experience for everyone!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Source, Open Science\n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific programming, all of the above scenarios are extremely common and important: scientific software often builds on previous work, or modifies it in interesting ways.\n",
    "And, because of the pace of scientific publishing and progress, much code is not thoroughly tested before release, resulting in minor or major bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great reason for making code open source is to promote reproducible research.\n",
    "Many of us have had the experience of reading a really cool paper, and then downloading the code to try it out on our own data.\n",
    "Only we find that the executable isn't compiled for our system. Or we can't work out how to run it.\n",
    "Or it has bugs, missing features, or produces unexpected results.\n",
    "By making scientific software open source, we not only increase the quality of that software, but we make it possible to see exactly how the science was done.\n",
    "What assumptions were made, and even hard-coded?\n",
    "Open source helps to solve many of these issues.\n",
    "It also enables other scientists to build on the code of their peers, fostering new collaborations and speeding up scientific progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Source Licenses\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want others to use your code, then you *must* license it.\n",
    "If you don't license your code, it is closed by default.\n",
    "Even if you publish your code (for example by placing it in a public GitHub repository), without a software license, no one is allowed to use, edit, or redistribute your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing among the many license options, you must first decide what you want to allow people to do with your code.\n",
    "Do you want people to be able to sell your code for profit?\n",
    "Or sell software that uses your code?\n",
    "Or do you want to restrict your code to be used only in free software?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two broad categories of FOSS license:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Permissive\n",
    "* Copy-left\n",
    "\n",
    "A permissive license means that you are giving anyone the write to use, edit, and redistribute your code in any way that they like.\n",
    "This includes using your code as part of commercial software.\n",
    "Some popular choices in this category include the MIT and BSD licenses.\n",
    "The SciPy community has adopted the New BSD License (also called \"Modified BSD\" or \"3-clause BSD\").\n",
    "Using such a license means receiving many code contributions from a wide array of people, including many in industry and start-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy-left licenses also allow others use, edit, and redistribute your code.\n",
    "These licenses, however, also prescribe that derived code must be distributed under a copy-left license.\n",
    "In this way, copy-left licenses restrict what users can do with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular copy-left license is the GNU Public License, or GPL.\n",
    "The main disadvantage to using a copy-left license is that you are often putting your code off-limits to any potential users or contributors from the private sector.\n",
    "And this could include your future self!\n",
    "This can substantially reduce your user base and thus the success of your software.\n",
    "In science, this could mean fewer citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more help choosing a license, see the [Choose a License website](http://choosealicense.com/).\n",
    "For licensing in a scientific context, we recommend this blog post by Jake VanderPlas, Director of Research in the Physical Sciences at the University of Washington, and all around SciPy superstar:\n",
    "http://www.astrobetter.com/the-whys-and-hows-of-licensing-scientific-code/.\n",
    "In fact we quote Jake here, to drive home the key points of software licensing:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...if you only take three pieces of information away from the article, let\n",
    "> them be these:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. Always license your code.  Unlicensed code is closed code, so any open license is better than none (but see #2).\n",
    "> 2. Always use a GPL-compatible license. GPL-compatible licenses ensure broad compatibility for your code, and include GPL, new BSD, MIT, and others (but see #3).\n",
    "> 3. Always use a permissive, BSD-style license. A permissive license such as new BSD or MIT is preferable to a copyleft license such as GPL or LGPL.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> — Jake VanderPlas, *[The Whys and Hows of Licensing Scientific\n",
    "> Code](http://www.astrobetter.com/the-whys-and-hows-of-licensing-scientific-code/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "All the code in this book is available under the 3-clause BSD license.\n",
    "Where we have sourced code snippets from other people, the code was generally under a permissive open license of some variety (although not necessarily BSD).\n",
    "\n",
    "For your own code, we recommend that you follow the practices of your\n",
    "community. In Scientific Python, this means 3-clause BSD, while the R language\n",

    "\n",
    "GitHub has had a massive effect on open source contributions.\n",
    "It did this by allowing users to publish code and collaborate for free.\n",
