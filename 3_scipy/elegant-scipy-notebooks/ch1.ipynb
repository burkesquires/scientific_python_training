    "this use case, which makes subsequent operations harder than they need to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reading the data in as a Pandas DataFrame we can let Pandas do all the parsing, then extract out the relevant information and store it in a more efficient data type.\n",
    "Here we are just using Pandas briefly to import data.\n",
