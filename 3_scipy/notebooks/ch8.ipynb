    "Briefly, your genetic information, the blueprint for making *you*, is encoded as a sequence of chemical *bases* in your *genome*.\n",
    "These are really, really tiny, so you can't just look in a microscope and read them.\n",
    "You also can't read a long string of them: errors accumulate and the readout becomes unusable.\n",
    "(New technology is changing this, but here we will focus on short-read sequencing data, the most common today.)\n",
    "Luckily, every one of your cells has an identical copy of your genome, so what we can do is shred those copies into tiny segments (about 100 bases long), and then assemble those like an enormous puzzle of 30 million pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing assembly, it is vital to perform read correction.\n",
    "During DNA sequencing some bases are incorrectly read out, and must be fixed, or they will mess up the assembly.\n",
    "(Imagine having puzzle pieces with the wrong shape.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One correction strategy is to find similar reads in your dataset and fix the error by grabbing the correct information from those reads. Or alternatively, you may choose to completely discard those reads containing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is a very inefficient way to do it, because finding similar reads means you would compare each read to every other read.\n",
    "This takes $N^2$ operations, or $9 \\times 10^{14}$ for a 30 million read dataset!\n",
    "(And these are not cheap operations.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another way.\n",
    "[Pavel Pevzner and others](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/17/9748.full) realized that reads could be broken down into smaller, overlapping *k-mers*, substrings of length k, which can then be stored in a hash table (a dictionary, in Python).\n",
    "This has tons of advantages, but the main one is that instead of computing on the total number of reads, which can be arbitrarily large, we can compute on the total number of k-mers, which can only be as large as the genome itself — usually 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose a value for k that is large enough to ensure any k-mer appears only once in the genome, the number of times a k-mer appears is exactly the number of reads that originate from that part of the genome.\n",
    "This is called the *coverage* of that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a read has an error in it, there is a high probability that the k-mers overlapping the error will be unique or close to unique in the genome.\n",
    "Think of the equivalent in English: if you were to take reads from Shakespeare, and one read was \"to be or nob to be\", the 6-mer \"nob to\" will appear rarely or not at all, whereas \"not to\" will be very frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basis for k-mer error correction: split the reads into k-mers, count the occurrence of each k-mer, and use some logic to replace rare k-mers in reads with similar common ones.\n",
    "(Or, alternatively, discard reads with erroneous k-mers.\n",
    "This is possible because reads are so abundant that we can afford to toss out erroneous data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also an example in which streaming is *essential*.\n",
    "As mentioned before, the number of reads can be enormous, so we don't want to store them in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA sequence data is commonly represented in FASTA format.\n",
    "This is a plaintext format, consisting of one or many DNA sequences per file, each with a name and the actual sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample FASTA file:"

    "few more curried calls in there, it's time share with you what it means!\n",
    "Currying is not named after the spice blend (though it does spice up your code).\n",
    "It is named for Haskell Curry, the mathematician who invented the concept.\n",
    "Haskell Curry is also the namesake of the Haskell programming language — in which\n",
    "*all* functions are curried!\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Currying\" means *partially* evaluating a function and returning another, \"smaller\" function.\n",
    "Normally in Python if you don't give a function all of its required arguments then it will throw a fit.\n",
    "In contrast, a curried function can just take *some* of those arguments.\n",
    "If the curried function doesn't get enough arguments, it returns a new function that takes the leftover arguments.\n",
    "Once that second function is called with the remaining arguments, it can perform the original task.\n",
    "Another word for currying is partial evaluation.\n",
    "In functional programming, currying is a way to produce a function that can wait for the rest of the arguments to show up later.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while the function call `map(np.log, numbers_list)` applies the `np.log`\n",
    "function to all of the numbers in `numbers_list` (returning a sequence of the\n",
    "logged numbers), the call `toolz.curried.map(np.log)` returns a *function* that\n",
    "takes in a sequence of numbers and returns a sequence of logged numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that having a function that already knows about some of the arguments is perfect for streaming!\n",
    "We've seen a hint of how powerful currying and pipes can be together in the\n",
    "above code snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "But currying can be a bit of a mind-bend when you first start, so we'll try it with some simple examples to demonstrate how it works.\n",

    ">     * Iterators get consumed.\n",

    ">  - When you have lots of functions in a pipe, it’s sometimes hard to figure out where things go wrong.\n",
    "     Take a small stream and add functions to your pipe one by one from the first/leftmost until you find the broken one.\n",
    "     You can also insert `map(do(print))` (`map` and `do` are from\n",

    "Make a function that can take a stream of data samples and perform PCA.\n",

    "dataset, which is in `data/iris.csv`. (You can also access it from the\n",
    "`datasets` module of scikit-learn, using `datasets.load_iris()`.) Optionally,\n",

    "## Markov model from a full genome\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our original code example.\n",
    "What is a Markov model, and why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a Markov model assumes that the probability of the system moving to a given state, is only dependent on the state that it was in just previously.\n",
    "For example if it is sunny right now, there is a high probability that it will be sunny tomorrow.\n",
    "The fact that it was raining yesterday is irrelevant.\n",
    "In this theory, all the information required to predict the future is encoded in the current state of things.\n",
    "The past is irrelevant.\n",
    "This assumption is useful for simplifying otherwise intractable problems, and\n",
    "often gives good results.\n",
    "Markov models are behind much of the signal processing in mobile phone and\n",
    "satellite communications, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of genomics, as we will see, different functional regions of a\n",
    "genome have different *transition probabilities* between similar states.\n",
    "Observing these in a new genome, we can predict something about the function of\n",
    "those regions. Going back to the weather analogy, the probability of going from\n",
    "a sunny day to a rainy day is very different depending on whether you are in\n",
    "Los Angeles or London. Therefore, if I give you a string of (sunny, sunny,\n",
    "sunny, rainy, sunny, ...) days, you can predict whether it came from Los\n",
    "Angeles or London, assuming you have a previously trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll cover just the model building, for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can download the *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit fly) genome file dm6.fa.gz from\n",
    "http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm6/bigZips/.\n",
    "You will need to unzip it using: `gzip -d dm6.fa.gz`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the genome data, genetic sequence, which consists of the letters A, C, G,\n",
    "and T, is encoded as belonging to *repetitive elements*, a specific class of\n",
    "DNA, by whether it is in lower case (repetitive) or upper case\n",
    "(non-repetitive). We can use this information when we build the Markov model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to encode the Markov model as a NumPy array, so we will make\n",
    "dictionaries to index from letters to indices in [0, 7] (`LDICT` for \"letters\n",
    "dictionary\"), and from pairs of letters to 2D indices in ([0, 7], [0, 7])\n",
