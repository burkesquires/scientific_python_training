    "Working with Graphs\n",
    "Graphs are an essential data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy provides us with the module scipy.sparse.csgraph for working with such data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "Adjacency matrix is a nxn matrix where n is the number of elements in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the values represents the connection between the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a graph like this, with elements A, B and C, the connections are:\n",
    "\n",
    "A & B are connected with weight 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A & C are connected with weight 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "C & B is not connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adjency Matrix would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      A B C\n",
    "   A:[0 1 2]  \n",
    "   B:[1 0 0]\n",

    "Dijkstra\n",
    "Use the dijkstra method to find the shortest path in a graph from one element to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "return_predecessors: boolean (True to return whole path of traversal otherwise False).\n",
    "indices: index of the element to return all paths from that element only.\n",
