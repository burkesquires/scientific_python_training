Contributing
=============

The SciPy lecture notes are a community-based effort and require constant
maintenance and improvements. New contributions such as wording
improvements or inclusion of new topics are welcome. 

To propose bugfixes or straightforward improvements to the notes, see the
contribution guide below.

For new topics, read the objectives first and `open an issue on the GitHub
project <https://github.com/scipy-lectures/scipy-lecture-notes/issues>`_ to
discuss it with the editors.


Objectives and design choices for the lecture notes
---------------------------------------------------

Contributors should keep the following objectives and design choices of
the SciPy lecture notes in mind.

Objectives:

* Provide a self-contained introduction to Python and its primary computational
  packages, the ”SciPy stack“.
* Provide tutorials for a selection of widely-used and stable computational
  libraries.
  Currently, we cover pandas, statmodels, seaborn, scikit-image,
  scikit-learn, sympy, and mayavi.
* Automated testing is applied to the code examples as much as possible.

Design choices:

* Each chapter should provide a useful basis for a 1‒2 h tutorial.
* The code should be readable.
* An idomatic style should be followed, e.g. ``import numpy as np``,
  preference for array operations, PEP8 coding conventions.


Contributing guide
------------------

The directory ``guide`` contains instructions on how to contribute:

.. topic::  **Example chapter**

  .. toctree::

   guide/index.rst

Building instructions
----------------------

To generate the html output for on-screen display, Type::

    make html

the generated html files can be found in ``build/html``

The first build takes a long time, but information is cached and
subsequent builds will be faster.

To generate the pdf file for printing::

    make pdf

The pdf builder is a bit difficult and you might have some TeX errors.
Tweaking the layout in the ``*.rst`` files is usually enough to work
around these problems.

Requirements
............

A complete list of requirements with information on the versions presently used
to build the SciPy lecture notes, can be inferred from the
:download:`requirements file <requirements.txt>`:

.. literalinclude:: requirements.txt
    :start-after: # libraries before the special comment marked

The installation instructions below cover (i) Debian/Ubuntu with miniconda as this is the
method we use to test and build the material and (ii) generic instructions using pip.

.. topic:: **Building on Debian/Ubuntu**

    The environment needed to create an html version of the SciPy lecture notes
    can be based on miniconda. We first download the latest version of miniconda
    and rename it to ``miniconda.sh`` for simplicity::

       wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh

    To ensure that the file has been downloaded correctly, one can compare the
    MD5 sum obtained by means of::

        md5sum miniconda.sh

    with the value listed on https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/ . Miniconda can
    now be installed::

        bash miniconda.sh
        
    Review the license agreement and choose a target directory (here we assume it
    to be ``$HOME/miniconda3``). Unless you intend to work more extensively with
    miniconda, you do not want to modify ``.bashrc``. In this case, you need::

        export PATH=$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH

    to find the correct binaries. Note that the path depends on the target directory
    chosen above.

    Now, we use ``environment.yml`` from the main directory of the ``scipy-lecture-notes``
    repository to install the required dependencies. Note that ``environment.yml`` yields
    an environment named ``testenv``. If you prefer a more telling name, make a copy of
    ``environment.yml``, replace ``testenv`` in line 4 by a more appropriate name and use
    this name in the following instead of ``testenv``. The conda environment is created
    by::

        conda env create -f environment.yml

    Now, the environment can be activated::

        source activate testenv

    and deactivated::

        source deactivate

    With an activated environment, you are now able to produce the html version of the
    SciPy as explained above. Generating a pdf version requires the system packages
    ``texlive``, ``texlive-latex-extra``, ``texlive-fonts-extra``, and ``latexmk``.

.. topic:: **Installing the Python packages with pip**

    `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_ is the recommended tool to install Python
    packages. However, a number of packages must be installed from the system. Install
    Python, the Python "headers" (the `python3-dev` package on Debian, for instance), a C
    development environment, `GNU Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_, a full LaTeX
    distribution (e.g. `TeX Live <https://www.tug.org/texlive/>`_ with extra fonts and
    utilities) and `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_.

    The remaining software can be installed with `pip`. Depending on the configuration, the
    probably most convenient and safe way to proceed is with::

        pip install --user -r requirements.txt

    This will install the software in a local directory belonging to the user and will not
    interfere with system-wide Python packages.
